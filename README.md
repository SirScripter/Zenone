# ZEONE
Zenone 
A Programming Language I Made When I Was Bored.

How It Got It's Name:

Z - for the First Letter Of My Name                                                                                                                                                                                
EONE - anagram for Neon (Neon Is Cool).  

E - It Looked Cool To Add On The End (It's A Silent "E")
